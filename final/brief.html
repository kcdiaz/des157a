    <h1>Final Project Design Brief</h1>

    <h2>Project Summary</h2>
	<p>The Game On! project will be updated with an illustration of a pig and the game will involve saving the pig from a falling rock by rolling the dice. The project will require the reconfiguration of rules, adding animations, and figuring out the JavaScript for the game.</p>
    
    <h2>Project Goals</h2>
	<p>The goal of this project is to enhance the user experience of the Game On! project by adding a new illustration and incorporating a new game element. The project is similar to other dice-based games but will differ in its unique visual and interactive elements.</p>

	<h2>Design Strategies</h2>
	<p>The design strategy will focus on a playful, cartoonish style with bright colors, bold typography, and an emphasis on the illustration of the pig. The design elements will prioritize visual hierarchy, with clear distinctions between game elements, and consistency in the overall look and feel. The design principles will focus on balance, contrast, and repetition to create a visually appealing interface. The Gestalt principle will also be considered to create a unified and cohesive design.</p>

	<h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
	<p>The interaction strategy will involve time-based behaviors, such as animations for the rolling dice and feedback for winning or losing the game. The visual and aural feedback will be designed to enhance the game's playfulness and add excitement for the user. The input methods will also be considered to ensure ease of use and accessibility for all users.</p>

	<h2>Experience Goals</h2>
	<p>The primary experience goal is to create a fun and engaging game for users that is easy to play and visually appealing. The secondary goal is to improve user engagement and interaction with the Game On! project by adding a new element. The experience will be achieved by focusing on the user's journey through the game and ensuring the game is easy to understand, enjoyable, and challenging enough to keep the user engaged.</p>
