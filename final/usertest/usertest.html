    <h1>User Test Results</h1>

    <h2>User #1</h2>
	<p>Users suggested that the game logic should be explained clearly and that the game should have sound effects, including a pig squeal. They also suggested changing the background per move, with a sunny background for going up and a cloudy background for going down. Additionally, users recommended limiting the scroll and overflow, but hiding it for the overlay background.</p>
    
    <h2>User #2</h2>
	<p>User's feedback focused on improving the game's visual elements. Specifically, she suggested adding an overlay that would indicate whether the pig is alive or dead, as well as checking the background positioning. </p>

	<h2>User #3</h2>
	<p>User provided feedback on the game's player interface and overall user experience. He suggested that the game's instructions should be more visible, either by showing them on the start page or making them more prominent within the game. Additionally, user recommended that the game should feature a story before it starts. This would add an extra layer of engagement for players and help to set the scene for the game's narrative.</p>

	<h2>User #4</h2>
	<p>User suggested that the game should have a visual indicator for player 1 and player 2, potentially improving the game's clarity and usability. Additionally, she recommended making the piggy character bigger, which would make it more prominent on the screen and potentially more appealing to players.</p>

	<h2>Next Steps</h2>
	<p>To improve my game, I will add an explanation about the game logic to players, use sound effects like a pig squeal, change backgrounds (sunny for going up, cloudy for going down), limit scroll and overflow, and add a visual indicator for player 1 and player 2. I will also consider adding an overlay to indicate whether the pig is alive or dead, check the background positioning, make game instructions more visible (potentially on the start page), include a story before the game starts, and make the pig character bigger. These changes will enhance user experience and engagement.</p>
