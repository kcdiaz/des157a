            <p>The game is played by two players, and on each turn, the current player rolls a pair of dice. The sum of the dice is added to the current player's score, as long as neither die shows a "one". If a player rolls two "ones" (snake eyes), their current score is reset to zero, and their turn ends. After each successful roll, the current player can choose to either roll again or pass the turn to the other player. </p>
            <p> The first player to reach a score of 30 points or higher wins. However, if a player rolls two "ones" (snake eyes), their score is reset to zero, so players must be careful to avoid this outcome.</p>
