        <p>Visual Literacy and Visual Thinking are essential skills to have in today's world, where we are constantly surrounded by images and media. As a designer, or even as a person navigating the media-saturated world, being able to analyze images and understand their impact through various perspectives is crucial.

        The article <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/"> 10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills </a>  was a great starting point for me to understand the basics of visual literacy. It provided examples of photographs that I could use to practice my close reading and visual thinking skills, which I found to be very helpful.

        After reading the article, I explored the website <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/"> Awwwards.com </a>, which features interesting and innovative websites each day. One website that stood out to me was "The Wilderness Downtown," a music video for the Arcade Fire's song "We Used to Wait." This website uses Google Maps and interactive elements to create a personalized experience for each user. The combination of music, images, and interaction makes for a truly unique and memorable experience.

        In conclusion, I believe that visual literacy and visual thinking are important skills to have, and this assignment has given me the opportunity to practice and develop these skills. I am excited to continue learning and improving my visual literacy and visual thinking abilities in the future.

        <p>I recently read an article on <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> tThe article provides an overview of modals, overlays, and dialog windows and what makes them a useful tool for UX design. It highlights the key features of these elements, such as clarity, accessibility, and simplicity, and provides guidelines for creating them effectively.</p>

        <p>One of the key takeaways from the article is that the design of modals, overlays, and dialog windows should prioritize the user's experience. This means ensuring that they are easy to use, visually appealing, and accessible to all users, regardless of ability. The article suggests using clear language and simple layouts to ensure that users can quickly understand the information presented in the modal or overlay. Additionally, the use of animations and transitions can help guide users' attention and make the overall experience more seamless.

        <p>I recently read an article on <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a> that provided several useful tips for designing an effective website form. One interesting thing I learned from the article is that it is important to limit the number of form fields to avoid overwhelming the user. By keeping the form concise and focused, the user is more likely to complete the form and submit their information. Another important factor to consider is the placement of form fields. According to the article, form fields should be placed in a logical order that makes sense for the user and helps them to complete the form more efficiently.</p>
        <p>A website form that I think exemplifies best practices is the sign-up form on the website for, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/register">Dropbox</a>. The form is simple and straightforward, with only a few form fields that are easy to complete. The placement of the form fields is logical, with the user's email address being asked for first, followed by their password. The form also provides clear instructions and prompts to help the user complete the form correctly. Overall, I think Dropbox's sign-up form is a great example of effective form design that is both user-friendly and efficient.
